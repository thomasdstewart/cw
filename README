cineworldscrape -  converts cinema listings to xml

It's a small python program that web scrapes the Cineworld website to convert
the cinema listing into xml format. For more information see: 
http://www.stewarts.org.uk/tomsweb/CineworldScrape

There are two ways to use it, either use the CineworldScrape class from your
own python programs or run it directly in standalone mode. The usual --help
will give a list of the various options. The main options are --scrape and
--transform. The former does the web scraping and writes the result to cw.xml
and the latter takes the xml and an xslt to produce a web mobile friendly
html file. I use the following cron entry to keep the data up to date:
0 5 * * * ~/www/cw/cineworldscrape.py --scrape --transform

You are free to download and run this yourself but you might need to change the
cinemaname defined in the class constructor from Stevenage to your local cinema.

Feel free to drop me a email with any questions of comments.
